# EHMD's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal [website](https://ehmd28.github.io). I created it using SvelteKit with the `adapter-staic` adapter.

**I make no claims of being a web developer nor a UI designer, which absolves me of any liability regarding coding style and design of the website :).**
