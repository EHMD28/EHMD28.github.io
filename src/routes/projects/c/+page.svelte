		<p>
			M-Calculator 4 is a fully featured scientific calculator written in pure C, no libraries
			(except ones I wrote). This is my first non-trivial project I created. If you're wondering why
			this is "version 4", it's because the other three versions were me trying to get the hang of
			trying to create a non-trivial program, and all of them failed for one reason or another. This
			project taught me a lot about how to create maintainable codebases.
