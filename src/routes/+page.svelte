	<h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
	<p>
		Greetings. My name is EHMD, and I am a software developer. My main interests are in robotics and
		low-level programming, but I also enjoy learning about data science and machine learning. My
		favorite programming languages are Rust and Kotlin, but I also like C and Python. Below are some
		of the projects I am most proud of.
