      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>C is one of the first programming languages I learned, and it is my favorite to work with. I am someone who
        enjoys learning how things work on a low level, so I enjoy the minimal abstractions that C provides. I will be
        the first to admit that C isn't the most productive language for a lot of use cases, but I still enjoy learning
        to implement things in C. I have also tried C++, but I don't have the same fondess for it that I do for C.</p>

        <h1>M-Calculator Version 3</h1>
        <div class="text-and-image">
          <p>This was my first non-trivial project in C. The project has gone through three iterations so far.
            M-Calculator Version 1 was barely functional (and has been removed from Github). The program simply
            evaluated operators from left to right, ignoring order of operators. M-Calculator Version 2 was better,
            taking into account order of operations. But the way the equation was represented was prone to error, and
            there was no error checking on the inputs. M-Calculator Version 3 was built after I learned more about data
            structures, and I implemented my first basic recursive descent parser. In the future, I plan to make an
            M-Calculator Version 4, a fully-featured scientific calculator rather than just an expression evaluator.
